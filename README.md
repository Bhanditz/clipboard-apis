##Clipboard Events spec

This repository contains the specification for Clipboard Events.

The editor's draft is live on [https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/](https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/) and the latest W3C Technical Report is [http://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/](http://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/).

Tests for the spec are maintained inside the source code of the spec itself. They are extracted and built into a test suite by running TC-generator/tc-gen.py. When [web-platform-tests/pull/1242](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/1242) is done, the tests will live in W3C's web-platform-tests suite.

Contributions welcome - both tests and suggested edits. The main focus at the moment is to create a good table of mappings between native clipboard data naming schemes on various platforms and the web's - see [http://sync.hoplahup.net/xwiki/bin/view/CnP/NamesForWebClipOps](http://sync.hoplahup.net/xwiki/bin/view/CnP/NamesForWebClipOps), deciding on the questions flagged as "issues" in the spec and closing the [open bugs](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?component=Clipboard%20API%20and%20events&list_id=54757&product=WebAppsWG&resolution=---).

This specification formerly used W3C's CVS repository but [that repo] (http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2006/webapi/clipops/) is no longer used for this specification.
